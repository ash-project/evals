      Define a struct named `User` with two fields: `name` (a string) and `age` (an integer with a default value of 0).
      Then, write a function `make_birthday/1` that takes a `User` struct and returns a new `User` struct with the age incremented by 1.
      Return the entire module containing both the struct definition and the function.
eval:
  assert:
    wrap_in_module: false
    assertion: |
      user = %User{name: "Alice"}
      birthday_user = User.make_birthday(user)
      assert birthday_user == %User{name: "Alice", age: 1}
